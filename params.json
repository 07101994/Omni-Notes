Don't be selfish or lazy!**\r\n\r\n####Dependences\r\n\r\nThey're all listed into the [build.gradle](https://github.com/federicoiosue/Omni-Notes/blob/develop/omniNotes/build.gradle) file but due to the fact that many of the dependences have been customized by me I'd like to say thanks here to the original developers of these great libraries:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/derekbrameyer/android-betterpickers\r\n* https://github.com/gabrielemariotti/changeloglib\r\n* https://github.com/LarsWerkman/HoloColorPicker\r\n* https://github.com/keyboardsurfer\r\n* https://github.com/neopixl/PixlUI\r\n\r\n\r\n##Developed with love and passion by\r\n\r\n\r\n* Federico Iosue - [Website](http://www.iosue.it/federico)\r\n* [Other contributors](https://github.com/federicoiosue/Omni-Notes/blob/master/contributors.md)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##License\r\n\r\n\r\n    Copyright 2015 Federico Iosue\r\n\r\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n    (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
