Note taking open-source application aimed to have both a lightweight footprint on system performances and simple interface but keeping smart behavior.

The project was created by the absence of such applications compatible with old phones and old versions of Android that would propose, however, an attractive look and aligned with the most recent design of the Google operating system

The application left the closed Beta but it's still in Beta stage, so please report any misbehaviour.
Follow the developments and post your comments and advice on Google+ Beta Comunity at https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/112276053772152071903
